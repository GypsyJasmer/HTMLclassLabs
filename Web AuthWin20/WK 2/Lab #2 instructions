what you learned last week as well as each of the following at least once:

    The <blockquote> element.
    The <figure> and <figcaption> elements.
    Special characters like â™¥.
    A nested list.
    A horizontal rule.
    Comments.

Check your page using the W3C HTML Validator

Create a review site that contains a home page and at least three review pages (you can re-use the page above).

    All the reviews will be in a sub-folder named reviews.
    Each review page should have at least one figure on it.
    All the images should be in one folder named images.
