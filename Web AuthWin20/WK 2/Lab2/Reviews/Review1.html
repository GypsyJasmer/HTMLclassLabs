                Julie of the Wolves, by Jean Craighead George, is the story of Miyax, a thirteen-year-old orphan. 
                Her mother is dead, and her father, Kapugen, went missing while he was hunting. 
                Julie runs away and plans to walk from Point Barrow to Point Hope, using the skills her father taught her to survive.

            <li style ="color:#262626"> This book holds a special place in my heart, and it's funny because I've never read this book. 
            In fourth grade I had to read this for a book report and I didn't but I still got an A+ on my book report. 
            Now for this assignment I actaully don't have to read the book. &#9829; I just have to show that I understand blockquotes (which I'm struggleing with), 
            figure and figcaption elements, special charaters, nested lists, horizontal rule, comments, and check HTML in W3C. 
            Hopefully I did a good job showing that I know those HTML items. </li>
